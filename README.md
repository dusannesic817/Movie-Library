## About the Project
An web application that allows users to manage their private film collection. This platform enables users to organize their movies, rent them out, 
maintain member records, track rental information and debts, and apply late fees in case of overdue returns.
Additionally, the application offers localization in the Serbian language, providing users with the option to use the platform in their preferred language.
Together, all of this creates a simple yet powerful tool for managing a film library, giving users complete control over their collections.
